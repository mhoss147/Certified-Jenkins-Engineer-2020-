# Jenkins installers are available for several Linux distributions.

Debian/Ubuntu

Fedora

Red Hat / CentOS




On Debian and Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu you can install Jenkins through apt.

Jenkins requires Java in order to run, yet certain distributions donâ€™t include this by default and some Java versions are incompatible with Jenkins.
