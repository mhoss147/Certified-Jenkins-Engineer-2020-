# Jenkins installers are available for several Linux distributions.

Debian/Ubuntu

Fedora

Red Hat / CentOS


On Debian and Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu you can install Jenkins through apt.

Jenkins requires Java in order to run, yet certain distributions don’t include this by default 
and some Java versions are incompatible with Jenkins.


# Installation of Java before Jenkins

To install the Open Java Development Kit (OpenJDK) run the following:

- Update the repositories

sudo apt update


- search of all available packages:

sudo apt search openjdk


- Pick one option and install it:

sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk


- checking installation:

java -version


// the result must be something like:

openjdk version "1.8.0_252"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_252-8u252-b09-1ubuntu1-b09)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.252-b09, mixed mode)


# Lets install Jenkins now

- To use this repository, first add the key to your system:

wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -

- Then add the following entry in your /etc/apt/sources.list:

sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > \
    /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'

- Update your local package index, then finally install Jenkins:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install jenkins


// f an error is reported, “jenkins : Depends: daemon but it is not installable”, 
add the "universe" apt repository of community maintained free and open source software for Ubuntu by executing this command after sudo apt-get update:

sudo add-apt-repository universe
