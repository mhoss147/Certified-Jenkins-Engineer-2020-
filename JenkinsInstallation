# Jenkins installers are available for several Linux distributions.

Debian/Ubuntu

Fedora

Red Hat / CentOS


On Debian and Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu you can install Jenkins through apt.

Jenkins requires Java in order to run, yet certain distributions donâ€™t include this by default 
and some Java versions are incompatible with Jenkins.


# Installation of Java before Jenkins

To install the Open Java Development Kit (OpenJDK) run the following:

- Update the repositories

sudo apt update


- search of all available packages:

sudo apt search openjdk


- Pick one option and install it:

sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk


- checking installation:

java -version


// the result must be something like:

openjdk version "1.8.0_252"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_252-8u252-b09-1ubuntu1-b09)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.252-b09, mixed mode)
